##Brief

1. Modify the column chart constructor function so you can pass it information as arguments in app.js rather than setting it in the columnChart.js file.


2. Try making a chart using the Rest Countries API data:

Make an HTTP request to the API.

Use the data from this request and pass it into one of your chart constructor functions - you may need to loop through it or use a method on it to change it into the appropriate format.
